Simulator for the Untimed, Synchronous, and Timed models of computation, as
described in _Modeling Embedded Systems and SoC's: Concurrency and Time in
Models of Computation_ by Axel Jantsch.

System Requirements
-------------------
This simulator was built using Python 2.6, and should run on any Python version
2.x later than 2.6 (any 2.6 or 2.7 release should work).  Due to breaking API
changes, Python releases 3.0 and later are *not* supported.

Mac OS 10.6 and most recent distributions of Linux should include a compatible
version of Python out of the box (run 'python' from a terminal window); Windows
users can download Python 2.7 from the [Python download page][py-dl].
